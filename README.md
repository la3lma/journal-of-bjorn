# Journal of Bjorn

This repository contains what amounts to my journal entries: Things
I for some reason found interesting and decided to pursue a bit.
My process is typically:

  - Find something interesting somewhere.  Hacker news, mainstream news,
    SoMe somewhere, something mentioned in passing in conversation, whatever.
  - Formulate, either by typing or dictating, a set of impressions and questions
    that intrigued me about the interesting thing.   Then ask one of
    several AIs (Claude, Chatgpt, Kimi2, Perplexity, Gemini  is a non-exhausting
    list of the AIs I regularly use) to expand on this.  Usually in a
    dialogue form.  I ask something, the AI answers, I ask some more
    etc.
  - At some point I stop the dialogue, collect the results from it
    put i in  a latex document, ask one or more AIs to formulate it
    as prose that will make it readable.
  - Ask the AIs to generate illustrations when that makes sense.
    The information for the illustrations is either available in the
    text itself or in the references.
  - Ask the AIs to scrutinize use of references.  References should be 
    real, so I make an effort to check that they actually exist,
    and that whatever they are claimed to support/ground in the note
    is actually something the article says something about.

... so then i get a note, a few pages long, in a style that is fit for
me to remember why I found this thing intriguing.  If this helps
others to do the same then I am happy.  If not, then I would of course
like to hear about possible improvements. I will take every suggestion
very seriously and try to implement every reasonable suggestion. But
also: This may not be for everyone, and I am fine with that too.
